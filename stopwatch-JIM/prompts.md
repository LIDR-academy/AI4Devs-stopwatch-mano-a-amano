# Prompt #1

*Stopwatch project*
Create a stopwatch similar to the file attached.

For this, I need a button menu to choose between a stopwatch and a countdown.
After user selection, and depends which type the user selects consider the following:
- For the stopwatch, I need a new screen where I can see the time progress and two buttons, one for start, another for pause if the timer starts, another for continue in case of pause the timer, and the last one for clear the timer.
- For the countdown, I need a collection of button numbers to select the time to countdown, after selecting the time the user can start the countdown or clear the timer. if the user starts the countdown we need to show similar buttons to the stopwatch. The exception here is the clear action that clears the countdown but with the set number by the user at the beginning, for example, if the user selects 3 seg and decides to clear, we need to show 3 seg again. Once the countdown is finalized play a ring ring sound (only 1 second duration)

use the following mask for the timer 00:00:00 and in a small below the numbers set the milliseconds as the following mask 000.

Independent of the view, set a button to go back to the initial menu.

The title of the page needs to show the updated timer second by second

For the UI/UX use your experience and set a good design with nice colors and font. Try to use big numbers.
Build this in vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS.
Separate the logic in a index.html, styles.css and scripts.js files
Do not use any third-party libraries.

# Prompt #2

Refine the following:
1) Remove the <h1 id="stopwatchTitle">00:00:00</h1> because is redundant. Instead of that I prefer to show that timer in the <title> tag of my HTML,
2) Can you give me a .mp3 file with a ring sound?, or a webpage where I can download for free?
3) For the countdown I prefer to have a time picker (form hours to seconds) where the user can select a specific time
4) Add some icons/images to the UI to be more user friendly
5) Add a progress bar in the countdown timer to show in a interactive way the timer
6) For the miliseconds use a small font, and place the numbers near the seconds

# Prompt #3

Give me all the code together instead of point by point, the original one with the refinements

# Prompt #4

For both, stopwatch and countdown, after clear action the timer, the pickers, and the action buttons need to restore to the initial state
