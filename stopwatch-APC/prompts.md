I want that you design a webpage with HTML, CSS and Javascript using a library like Tailwind and not using JQuery to have two features: a stopwatch and a countdown.

For the stopwatch: I want an option to start, to pause/resume, to restart (restart)
For the countdown: I want to be able to write the hours, minutes and seconds and I want to have a start, a pause/resume, a botton to restart since the initial time set and an option to clear

-----------------

Let's try to improve some elements. We will have stopwatch and countdown features separated by a tab component being able to see only one feature at the same time. If we switch from one to another, we don't lose the data.

In terms of interface, I want that the buttons are visible only when is necessary. For example, once I press start, doesn't make sense to keep the start.

Also, for the buttons replace the texts my emojis.

For the countdown, I want to be able to write the text in the "countdown-display" component.

Add miliseconds to both features.

-----------------

There is something missing, I don't see the buttons in the initial state. Also, when I switch from one tab to another, I lose the "blue" initial design. Also, I want to see loaded by default the stopwatch without having to click. Finally, the countdown doesn't need anymore the element initially introduced to type the countdown I want

-----------------

Now, after the solution achieved, propose me something else and implement it.

-----------------

Nice! I integrated the lap feature. Now, some fixes of interface. After clicking "Countdown", I lose the blue background in the button clicked and I don't recovered even coming back to "Stopwatch". Could you fix it? Also, could you make the switch between both features with an animation?

The second one. Instead of using emojis inside a buttons with color, could you replace by icons (maybe from Tailwin), but keeping the colors?

The third one, could you show "Laps:" only after pressing for the first time to store a lap?
