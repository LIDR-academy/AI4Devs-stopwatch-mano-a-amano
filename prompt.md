#1 prompt

As a front developper I want to create a simple web based stopwatch and countdown timer built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The web page should be fully responsive.
Use this website as reference https://www.online-stopwatch.com/

The home page name should be "stopwatch & countdown" with 2 centered on the same line buttons. the first one is named stopwatch and the second one countdown.

When clicking on stopwatch, a timer appear with 2 buttons start and clear. the timer is the central and biggest component. The 2 buttons should be placed bellow. 
The first button on the left is the "start" button in color green. When I click on it the timer start and the button became a blue "pause" button. When pause is clicked the timer pause and the button became the start button again.
The second red button on the right is the "clear" one. when clicked the timer reset.

When clicking on countdown, I need an editable timer with only numbers to set a time and a start and clear button. When the coutndown is over play a sound alert during 1 second.

Use the following mask for both timer 00:00:00.

Use your experience to set an homogeneous and sleek design 
Split the code into 3 files: index.html, styles.css and scripts.js.

It's working.
Can you modify the size of the timer to be sure we alsways see all the number? The countdown doesn't display everything.
Can you also add a link to return to the home page when we are on the timer or countdown screen that hidde correctly the countdown and the timer.
Can you regenerate the code to match theses modifications
