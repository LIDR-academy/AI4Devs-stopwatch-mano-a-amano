# Prompt 1

Put yourself in the role of an experienced frontend developer with high skills in HTML, Javascript, CSS and Jest.
I would like you to create a web application that implements a stopwatch. You can see the following link as a reference: https://www.online-stopwatch.com/
The application will have a timer and two buttons:
1) The timer will count time from zero to 99 hours and it would show time from hours to milliseconds
2) It will have a start button in green colour. It will start the stopwatch
3) It will have a clear button in red colour. It will put back the timer to the initial state
Basic functionality:
1) When the user clicks on the start button, the stopwatch start working, the start button changes the colour to blue and the text will say “Pause”
2) If the user clicks on Pause, the stopwatch will stop, the pause button will become orange and the text would say “Continue” 
3) If the user clicks on Continue, the stopwatch will resume working, the button will become again blue and would say again “Pause”
4) If the user clicks on “Clear” button, the stopwatch will go back to the initial state, and the “Pause” button would say again “Start” in green colour
Files:
I would need a index.html, script.js and styles.css files
Finally, create proper unit tests in Jest for this functionality

# Prompt 2

When I click on the start button, the timer does not start working

# Prompt 3 

When I open the index.html in the browser I can see this error in the console and the stopwatch is not working: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
